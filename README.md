# Docker flightradar24 feed
A flightradar24 feed docker container, with dump1090 designed and built to run on a Pi (arm64).

I will add the --signup process in at some point with further instructions on how to use this container, but for the time being you just need to make sure FR24_KEY is correct in docker-compose.yaml and you share your receiver USB with the container.
