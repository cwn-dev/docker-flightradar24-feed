# Docker flightradar24 feed
A flightradar24 feed docker container, with dump1090 designed and built to run on a Pi (arm64).

I will add the --signup process in at some point with further instructions on how to use this container, but for the time being you just need to make sure fr24key is correct in fr24feed.ini and you share your receiver USB with the container.
